/**
 * API Configuration - Centralized HTTP Client for ShopVerse
 *
 * This file configures and exports a centralized Axios instance for making HTTP requests
 * to the ShopVerse backend API. It provides a consistent base configuration for all
 * API calls throughout the application, including the base URL, default headers,
 * and any necessary interceptors for request/response handling.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Centralized API configuration for consistent HTTP requests
 * - Base URL configuration for backend server communication
 * - Reusable Axios instance for all API calls in the application
 * - Extensible configuration for adding interceptors, headers, and middleware
 * - Environment-specific configuration support for development and production
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Import this configured API instance in service files or components
 * - Use standard Axios methods: api.get(), api.post(), api.put(), api.delete()
 * - Base URL is automatically prepended to all requests
 *
 * @module APIClient

/**
 * Configured Axios Instance
 *
 * Creates a pre-configured Axios instance with base settings for the ShopVerse API.
 * This instance can be used throughout the application for consistent API communication.
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - baseURL: Points to the local development server on port 5000
 * - Future enhancements: Can include default headers, timeout, interceptors
 *
 * Development vs Production:
 * - Currently configured for local development (localhost:5000)
 * - Should be updated with environment variables for production deployment
 * - Consider using process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL for flexibility
 */

/**
 * Environment Configuration Variables
 *
 * Defines base URLs for different deployment environments to enable
 * easy switching between development, staging, and production servers.
